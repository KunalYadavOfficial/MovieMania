# MovieMania


**MovieMania** is a sample Movie and Tv Series details Android application 📱 built to demonstrate use of *Modern Android development* tools. Dedicated to all Android Developers with ❤️. 



## About
It simply loads **Movies & Tv Series** data from TMDB API and stores it in persistence storage (i.e. SQLite Database). Data will be always loaded from local database. Remote data (from API) and Local data is always synchronized. 
- This makes it offline capable 😃. 
- Clean and Simple Material UI.

*TMDB API is used in this app. [here](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs)*.
